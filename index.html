            <h2>SRM PUBLIC SCHOOL </h>
            <p> SRM Public School is now accepting admissions for academic year 2023- 24 from classes Pre KG to Grade XI.
                 Each class will have not more than 35 students. This ensures that our student teacher ratio remains low, thereby promoting healthy and frequent interactions between teachers and students. 
                 SRM aims to create a personalised education experience for each student and provide a platform to maximize each studentâ€™s learning while nurturing individual potential.

                 To find out more about admissions at SRM or to visit the school for an admission tour,please contact the Admissions Officer between 08:30 a.m and 4:00 p.m., during working days.
